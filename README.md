# SMART CONTRACTS FOR JOINT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

This repo contains a Solidity script for a smart contract that automates the process of hosting joint savings accounts.  

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, the Solidity smart contract accepts two user addresses. These addresses are able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account, including the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies

This application leverages Solidity version 0.5.0.

## Installation Guide

* Begin by cloning the GitHub repo (the same repo that this README.md file is contained within) into your terminal. 

* Next, download [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

* After installing and opening Ganache, copy the mnemonic phrase listed up top. For reference (the 12 words behind the black highlight):
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="./Images/mnemonic.png" width="500" height="200"/></p>

* Create a '.env' file and within it paste the following: 
```bash
MNEMONIC = "(Whatever you copied from Ganache)"
```
* Within your terminal, navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo.

## Running the Code

* While in your terminal in this cloned repo, enter the following command:

```python
streamlit run fintech_finder.py
```
* A web browser window or tab will open. You will now be able to interact with the application.

## Usage

There are two Python scripts contained within this repo: **fintech_finder.py** and **crypto_wallet.py.** The first script runs the Streamlit code and imports various Etherum-based wallet functions from **crypto_wallet.py.**

The application first generates a new Ethereum account instance using the user's mnemonic seed phrase (created during the Installation section of the README.md detailed above). Next, the account balance associated with the user's Ethereum account address is fetched and displayed.

After the user selects their candidate to hire and how many hours they wish to hire them for, the total value of the Ethereum transaction, including the gas fee, is calculated 

The user then digitally signs the transaction to pay the candidate, and sends this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

A transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction is generated below in the Streamlit sidebar.

For further confirmation, the user can navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. Here is an example of a successful transaction and the balance deducted from the user's account in Ganache:
