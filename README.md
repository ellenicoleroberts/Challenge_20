# SMART CONTRACTS FOR JOINT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

This repo contains a Solidity smart contract that automates the process of hosting joint savings accounts.  

To create this automation, the smart contract accepts two user addresses that are able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account, including the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies

This application leverages Solidity version 0.5.0.

* Next, in your web browser go to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

* In the file section, navigate to the cloned repo and open the __join_savings.sol__ Solidity smart contract.


---
## Running the Solidity Smart Contract

* While in Remix, navigate to the "Compile" secion and first compile the smart contract.

* Next navigate to the "Deploy" section and deploy the smart contract.

* In the sidebar on the left towards the bottom, you will see the name of the smart contract. Click on the arrow next to it, which will display a number of buttons corresponding to the contract's functions.

The second example is a deposit of 10 ETH. Note how upon clickng the 'contractBalance' button, the updated balance is displayed:

![transaction example.](ExecutionResults/deposit10eth.png)


The third example is a deposit of 5 ETH. Note how upon clickng the 'contractBalance' button, the updated balance is displayed:

![transaction example.](ExecutionResults/deposit5eth.png)


The next example is a withdraw of 5 ETH. Note how upon clickng the 'contractBalance' button, the updated balance is displayed:

![transaction example.](ExecutionResults/withdraw5eth.png)


This following example pertains to the withdraw of 5 ETH. This is a screenshot of what to expect in the terminal output that displays confirmation of the process:

The next example is a withdraw of 10 ETH. Note how upon clickng the 'contractBalance' button, the updated balance is displayed:

![transaction example.](ExecutionResults/withdraw10eth.png)


This following example pertains to the withdraw of 10 ETH. This is a screenshot of what to expect in the terminal output that displays confirmation of the process:
